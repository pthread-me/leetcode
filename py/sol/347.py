import heapq

# My initial solution was a hashmap which works fine,
# we can use a maxheap, first use a hashmap to find the frequency of the elements
# then have a max_heap of pairs where we compare based on the freq
# python only has a min heap so a trick we can use is to negate the frequecy (times -1)
# if we were not dealing with ints/floats we would need to modify internal funcs or implement it ourselves. easy
